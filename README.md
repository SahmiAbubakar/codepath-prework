## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
GeeksForGeeks, Stack overflow, youtube

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]
The challenge I encountered while creating this submission was that I had forgotten most of the syntax for HTML,CSS, and JavaScript, however through a few google searches, and some reading I was able to surmount this challenge pretty easily. In JavaScript, I did not know what let did, and had to search this attribute up on geeks for geeks. On top of this, I was not sure how functions worked in Javascript, and needed to view some examples on how it is possible to use a function within another function. To further learn how to use the three languages, I watched youtube courses on how the syntax is formatted, and how to apply basic concepts in the Light And Sound game. This allowed me to better understand the code, and made it more comfortable to add new lines of code to the files. The CSS side of things was much more familiar and easy to use because you are editing classes, and it is easy to view the changes that are made in real time, however the padding and spacing is still very confusing to me. To resolve my lack of knowledge in CSS, I went to geeks for geeks in which they had a section that reviews the different ways that padding can be used inside of CSS. 
3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]
After completing this submission, the questions that I have are how would this work on a scalability level, as I know that most websites are hosted on a server. On top of this (in a business aspect), the site must be semi profitable in order to be kept alive, or it does not make sense for the resources to be allocated, so how is it possible to integrate advertisements within a website. The final question I have is how does collaboration in the workspace in terms of web development work? I have heard that the best way to overcome a problem that you cannot identify is to have another set of eyes take a look at your work, and learn from the input received.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]
If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would add a random generator for the order that the sound is played because after the first win, the user already knows the order that the sounds play, and can keep winning repeatedly with ease. In order to do this, a random number generator can be set, and if statements can be declared to put the number 1, 2, 3 ,or 4 into the array in a random order. This array will be changed each time the user has completed a turn, and will serve to make the game more challenging for second coming users.
